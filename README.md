# LedBLEControll Mac OS application

A demonstration application, which provides an ability to control the LED via the Bluetooth channel. Basically, it is written for the serie of the articles which describe how to create Bluetooth-controlled Arduino devices. Original articles links are:

* [Make a Bluetooth-driven electronic device with Arduino at its heart — Part 1](https://thebrainfiles.wearebrain.com/make-a-bluetooth-driven-electronic-device-with-arduino-at-its-heart-part-1-fefd67d55200)
* [Make a Bluetooth-driven electronic device with Arduino at its heart — Part 2](https://thebrainfiles.wearebrain.com/make-a-bluetooth-driven-electronic-device-with-arduino-at-its-heart-part-2-e33ec9c74733)
* Make a Bluetooth-driven electronic device with Arduino at its heart — Part 3 (will be published soon)

This application is written exactly for the 3rd part. First two parts describe some low level concepts and ability to control the LED using some 3rd party application to debug Bluetooth devices.


Enjoy!
